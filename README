This is the work in progress modularized SneezyMUD client.

Required perl Modules:
 Net/Telnet
 Term/ReadKey

It also contains a copy of the original monolithic script version for reference: 
oldversion_ref_copy.pl

For testing, launch testserver.sh in one window and run trycode.bat in another window.

For live testing and connect to the MUD execute ./trycode.bat live
