This is the work in progress modularized SneezyMUD client.

Required perl Modules:
 Net/Telnet
 Term/ReadKey

It also contains a copy of the original monolithic script version for reference (or playing.. works great):

	oldversion_ref_copy.pl

For testing, launch testserver.sh in one window and run trycode.bat in another window.

Screenshot.png shows an example of using testserver.sh for testing

For live testing and connect to the MUD execute ./trycode.bat live

Adjust the squelch with #squelch for your level of playing or testing
