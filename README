This is the work-in-progress modularized SneezyMUD client. Testers would want to familiarize themselves with v1 which is included 

	oldversion_ref_copy.pl

For old version playing/learning or new version testing will be required some Perl Modules:

 Net/Telnet
 Term/ReadKey

The Turtle Shell client makes no concessions for Windows users; but I believe if you get Cygwin libraries installed on Windows and use the Cygwin terminal, it would play just fine with that. I'm willing to work with you to get that working - feel free to get in touch.

I intend to split this project at some point for the Sneezy Client to use Sneezy Client codes directly and be a general shell on the other fork.

For new version development testing, launch testserver.sh in one window and run trycode.bat in another window.

Screenshot.png shows an example of using testserver.sh for testing

For live testing and connect to the MUD execute "./trycode.bat live"

Adjust the squelch with #squelch for your level of playing or testing
